# Portfolio Update
Portolio with a responsive layout.

# Description

This portfolio was modified and updated from the previous. In this update, I have included buttons and links to social contacts, and professional contacts. Created links that will direct to my projects, and other works that I have accomplished. Using bootstrap 4.4 helped in the design and layout of the site.
